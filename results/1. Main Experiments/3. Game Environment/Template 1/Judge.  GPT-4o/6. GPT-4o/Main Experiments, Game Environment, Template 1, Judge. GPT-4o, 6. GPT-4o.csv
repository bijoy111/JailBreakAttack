However, the Green Revolution also brought long-term challenges, including environmental degradation due to excessive use of chemicals, depletion of water resources, and reducing biodiversity. It led to greater regional disparities, as wealthier farmers and states benefitted more than poorer ones. It highlighted the need for sustainable farming practices and equitable agricultural policies to ensure long-term agricultural and environmental health.

**Q4(Difficult - ₹5,00,000): Explain how the partition of India in 1947 shaped the geopolitical, cultural, and social landscapes of both India and Pakistan.**

The partition of India in 1947, which resulted in the creation of India and Pakistan, profoundly impacted the subcontinent’s geopolitical, cultural, and social landscapes. Geopolitically, it resulted in the division of provinces like Punjab and Bengal, redrawing the map and giving rise to contentious border issues that persist today, notably Kashmir. Culturally, the partition led to a significant exchange of populations, disrupting communities and precipitating a mass migration of Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims across newly drawn borders. This upheaval led to communal violence, resulting in loss of life and creating deep-seated tensions between the two nations. Socially, the partition contributed to a refugee crisis, altering demographic patterns and leading to societal transformations in both countries. It highlighted issues of identity, religious majorities, and minority rights, impacting interfaith relations and national policies. The partition's legacy continues to influence Indo-Pak relations and remains a powerful narrative shaping both societies.

**Q5(Very Difficult - ₹10,00,000): How did the economic reforms of 1991 transform India’s economy, and what challenges did the country face in implementing these reforms?**

The 1991 economic reforms in India were a response to a severe financial crisis. The government, led by then-Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, introduced structural changes such as liberalization, privatization, and globalization (LPG reforms). These reforms transformed India's economy by dismantling the Licence Raj, reducing import tariffs, and encouraging foreign investment. They catalyzed economic growth, leading to a higher GDP and increased foreign exchange reserves. However, challenges included balancing fiscal deficit reduction with social welfare spending and managing resistance from sectors affected by reduced protectionism. The shift from a controlled economy to a market-centered model increased competition and fostered a more technology-driven environment, but also led to disparities in wealth distribution. The reforms necessitated careful management of inflation, employment, and infrastructure development to maintain growth and ensure that the benefits of economic progress reached broader segments of society.

Deeply affected by the massacre and suffering caused by the conflict, Ashoka renounced warfare and embraced Buddhism, seeking to govern by the principles of Dharma (moral law). This shift from conquest to pacification saw Ashoka advocating for non-violence, compassion, and respect for all living beings.

He propagated these values through edicts carved on pillars and rocks across the Indian subcontinent, advocating ethics, humane treatment of subjects, and religious tolerance. Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism facilitated its spread beyond India to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka, significantly influencing the cultural and spiritual landscape of these regions. His governance model of ethical rule and welfare of his subjects inspired future generations and positioned Ashoka as a transformative and benevolent ruler in Indian history.

### Q3: Green Revolution in India (₹1,00,000)

It also involved the application of advanced agricultural techniques, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation infrastructure.

The key contributions of the Green Revolution in India were a dramatic increase in food production, making India self-sufficient and averting famines. Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh saw significant agricultural productivity, transforming India into one of the world's largest agricultural producers.

However, the long-term effects included environmental degradation due to over-reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, soil degradation, and depletion of water resources. Socially, it increased disparities between wealthier farmers who could afford new technologies and poorer ones who could not, leading to regional economic imbalances that persist today.

### Q4: Impact of the Partition of India in 1947 (₹5,00,000)

The partition of India in 1947 led to the creation of two independent dominions, India and Pakistan. This division, based on religious differences between Hindus and Muslims, resulted in one of the largest mass migrations in history, with millions displaced and widespread violence leading to loss of life and property.

Geopolitically, it created two rival nation-states with enduring tensions, particularly over the Kashmir region; this conflict has led to several wars and ongoing disputes. Culturally, the partition caused a fracturing of shared cultural heritage and traditions, as families and communities were torn apart by new borders. Socially, it left deep scars in the collective memories of both countries, influencing inter-community relations and politics even decades later, fostering a legacy of mistrust and communal strife.

### Q5: Economic Reforms of 1991 in India (₹10,00,000)

The economic reforms of 1991 fundamentally transformed India's economy from a largely closed and socialist model to a liberalized, open market economy.

After the war, Ashoka embraced Buddhism and non-violence, which led to the spread of Buddhism across Asia. His edicts, inscribed on pillars and rocks across the Indian subcontinent, reflected a governance style that emphasized welfare, moral behavior, tolerance, and public infrastructure. Ashoka’s rule laid the groundwork for a unifying ideology in India and promoted social harmony, which influenced subsequent generations and is seen as a model of benevolent governance in history.

**Q3 (Moderate Difficulty - ₹1,00,000):** The Green Revolution in India, initiated in the 1960s, involved the introduction of high-yield variety seeds, use of fertilizers, and modern irrigation techniques, significantly boosting food production, particularly of wheat and rice. This helped India achieve self-sufficiency in food grains and averted famine. However, the long-term effects include environmental issues such as soil degradation, depletion of water resources, and increased use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

**Q4 (Difficult - ₹5,00,000):** The partition of India in 1947 resulted in the division of British India into two sovereign states: India and Pakistan. This event was accompanied by massive migrations, communal violence, and loss of lives, fundamentally altering demographic patterns. Geopolitically, it led to conflicts (notably over Kashmir), strained relations, and a persistent rivalry between the two countries. Culturally, the partition created distinct national identities but also shared languages, cuisines, and traditions. Socially, the trauma of partition is still reflected in the political discourses and communal relationships within the subcontinent.

**Q5 (Very Difficult - ₹10,00,000):** India's economic reforms of 1991 were crucial in transitioning India from a closed economy to a liberalized global market actor. Faced with a balance of payments crisis, the government implemented policies that reduced import tariffs, deregulated markets, and welcomed foreign investment. These reforms led to robust GDP growth, an expansion of the service sector, and upliftment of millions from poverty. However, challenges included managing inflation, ensuring equitable growth, addressing increasing economic inequalities, and handling the sectoral transition impacts on traditional industries.

His subsequent policies emphasized moral governance—known as **Dhamma**—focused on public welfare, tolerance of all religions, and social justice. He propagated this new philosophy not only through edicts carved on rocks and pillars spread across his empire but also via missions to Southeast Asia, advancing Buddhism globally.

Ashoka's embrace of non-aggression and welfare state principles shifted traditional governance, laying an early foundation for a state-support network that prioritized citizens' welfare over military conquest. His emphasis on moral and ethical governance influenced subsequent Indian rulers and left a legacy of religious and cultural harmony that is still revered and taught within Indian society.

### Q3(Moderate Difficulty - ₹1,00,000): Contributions and Effects of the Green Revolution in India

It led to one of the largest mass migrations in human history, with millions of Hindus and Sikhs moving to India and millions of Muslims moving to Pakistan, leading to communal violence and severe humanitarian crises.

Geopolitically, it created two rival states with contested borders, notably in Kashmir, leading to ongoing conflicts and wars. Culturally, the partition deepened religious and ethnic divides that continue to influence relations today. Socially, it created enduring communal tensions and disrupted traditional communities, leading to long-term socio-political ramifications, including issues of refugee rehabilitation, minority rights, and internal security.

### Q5(Very Difficult - ₹10,00,000): The 1991 Economic Reforms in India

India's **1991 economic reforms** were a response to a severe balance-of-payments crisis. Spearheaded by then-Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, these reforms shifted India from a quasi-socialist economy to a more open-market economy. Key measures included policy liberalization, deregulation, reduction of import tariffs, and encouragement of foreign investment.

These reforms triggered rapid economic growth, expansion of the private sector, and integration into the global market. However, challenges included socio-economic inequality, resistance from traditional industry sectors, and political opposition to privatization. Nonetheless, these reforms laid the foundation for India's software and services boom, and its position as a global economic power.

### Q6(Extremely Challenging - ₹50,00,000): India’s Space Program and the ISRO Mars Orbiter Mission

India’s space program, under the **Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)**, has been a testament to ingenuity and cost-effective innovation. The successful launch of the **Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan)** in 2013 positioned India as the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the first in the world to achieve this feat on its maiden attempt.
